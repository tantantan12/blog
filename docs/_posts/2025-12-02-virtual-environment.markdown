In Python, different packages can conflict with each other due to version incompatibilities. In addition, you may need to install large packages for a single experimental project, which can clutter your global environment. You may want to delete this experimental project without affecting other projects. A virtual environment solves these problems.

A Python virtual environment is a project-specific, isolated workspace that contains its own interpreter and dependencies. It ensures that each project has exactly the packages—and versions—it needs, without affecting other projects or the system-wide Python installation.

For a detailed introduction to Python virtual environments, see this [article][article].
